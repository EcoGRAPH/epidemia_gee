# epidemia-gee

The epidemia-gee package is a new python package in the EPIDEMIA system for interfacing with Google Earth Engine (GEE) from R via python. The package is built for an Ethiopian national-level data collection, and an example script is included in the epidemiar-demo project to show how this linkage can be used to gather GEE environmental data from a script in R, rather than using another external application (e.g. GEE code editor in a web browser).
